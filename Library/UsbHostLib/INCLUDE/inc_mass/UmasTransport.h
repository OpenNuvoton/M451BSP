/* Driver for USB Mass Storage compliant devices
 * Transport Functions Header File
 *
 * $Id: transport.h,v 1.13 2000/10/03 01:06:07 mdharm Exp $
 *
 * Current development and maintenance by:
 *   (c) 1999, 2000 Matthew Dharm (mdharm-usb@one-eyed-alien.net)
 *
 * This driver is based on the 'USB Mass Storage Class' document. This
 * describes in detail the protocol used to communicate with such
 * devices.  Clearly, the designers had SCSI and ATAPI commands in
 * mind when they created this document.  The commands are all very
 * similar to commands in the SCSI-II and ATAPI specifications.
 *
 * It is important to note that in a number of cases this class
 * exhibits class-specific exemptions from the USB specification.
 * Notably the usage of NAK, STALL and ACK differs from the norm, in
 * that they are used to communicate wait, failed and OK on commands.
 *
 * Also, for certain devices, the interrupt endpoint is used to convey
 * status of a command.
 *
 * Please see http://www.one-eyed-alien.net/~mdharm/linux-usb for more
 * information about this driver.
